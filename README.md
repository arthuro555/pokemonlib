## WARNING:
**I Am not and don't claim to be affiliated with Pokemon or the Pokemon Company or Nintendo.
I do not own and don't claim to own Pokemon, the battle logic of the algorithm, the sprites,
the idea and the code of any official pokemon game. But I do own The code that is written by myself
and the way it was implemented.**

This is a library containing a WIP (Work In Progress) implementation of the pokemon battle algorithm and
other features of the pokemon games.

#### Present features:

* Automatically get base pokemon data from the PokeApi

#### WIP features
###### I mean what I'm actively working on (Checked if ready for release soon and currently in test)

- [ ] Pokemon Class
- [ ] Inventory/Player class
- [ ] Pokemon attacks
- [ ] Automatically get other pokemon data like sprites from the PokeApi
- [ ] Basic Battle UI (Very slow progress)
- [ ] Automatic game build

#### Planned Features:
###### (Checked means I'm starting to develop it as soon as I complete a WIP feature)

+ [X] Plugin System that permits to create your own pokemons/attacks/items
+ [X] Items (Needs Inventory first)
- [ ] Battle Logic (A class that handles the whole battle but without any UI)
- [ ] Overworld UI
- [ ] Trainers battle
- [ ] Possibility to catch pokemons
- [ ] Interaction system in Overworld

And possibly more ;-) you can always make a feature request in the issues tab.


## Python Compatibility

For now only python 3 is supported and python 2 support is not planned.
Anyways, if you're still using python 2, you should upgrade!

## Helping or contributing to the project

I have no problem with people helping me. If someone makes many good pull request I will consider to add them
as contributors of this repo. If someone contributes to the project by more than a few lines of code or do
something really useful (like some english teacher who fixes all the typos) I will add them to a credit section
and a file credits.txt.

### What this project is meant to become

This project is for now pieces of code on which you can use to make a simple pokemon game.
I want it to become a piece of software that you extend with your own script(s) and plugins, a bit like renpy. 
If I manage to finish all the core and Engine part maybe a visual editor will be made.
